# Fitting individual-based models of spatial population dynamics to long-term monitoring data


This is supplementary material to the publication  

*"Fitting individual-based models of species range dynamics to long-term monitoring data"*

by Anne-Kathleen Malchow, Guillermo Fandos, Urs G. Kormann, Martin U. Grüebler, Marc Kéry, Florian Hartig, Damaris Zurell.  

It contains the R scripts and data needed to reproduce all results. The code uses a developmental version of the R package *RangeShiftR*, which omits all file inputs and outpus. It can be found in the RangeShiftR repo under the development tag [v.1.1-beta.0](https://github.com/RangeShifter/RangeShiftR-package/releases/tag/v.1.1-beta.0).  


**Funding**

AM and DZ were supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) under grant agreement No. ZU 361/1-1.


**Data provision**

The study uses data from the Swiss breeding bird atlas 1993-96 ([Schmid et al., 1998](#1)) and the Swiss breeding bird index ([Knaus et al., 2022](#2)) provided by the Swiss ornithological institute, Sempach.
The repository contains processed versions of this data.

## Folder *data*

All input data required to run the model calibration: ASCII rasters of habitat maps, the initial distribution model, and spatially aggregated counts from the Swiss breeding bird survey, and the spatial blocking of the gridded landscape.

## Folder *scripts*

#### *scripts/calibration*

The scripts to run the model calibration. The calibration routine is contained in *RangeShiftR_calibration.R*, which loads functions defined in the other scripts.

#### *scripts/analysis*

The scripts to process and analyse the MCMC chains produced in the calibration. Reads and combines the independent MCMCs for each fold; plots diagnostics, marginal distributions, and correlations; performs the spatial-block cross-validation and produces prior/posterior predicitons. Creates all plots. All routines are contained in "analysis_main.R*, which loads functions defined in the other scripts.

## Folder *model*

Contains the RangeShiftR folder structure.

## Folder *results*

Contains the simulation results for validation and prediction as well as the sub-folders to store further results.
